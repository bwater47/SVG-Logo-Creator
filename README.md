# SVG-Logo-Creator
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
This application generates a logo based on the prompted questions inside of the VS Code studio.

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was to create a generator that helps the coder generate a logo.svg file for their project.
- This project was built to help coders create a logo.svg file for their projects.
- This solves the problem of not knowing how to create a logo.svg file.
- In this project I learned that you can generate .svg files, use node.js to run files from within the CLI, and test your javascript files from the CLI in VS Code.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, and Node.js. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally in your device you can open VSCode. Lastly once VSCode is running, open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), and type node index.js to be prompted with the questions for the logo.svg.

## Usage

Generating a logo.svg file: Use node.js inside of VS Code, and target the index.js file when using the "node path.file" command in the terminal on VS Code. This will prompt you with questions that you will fill out. Once completed you will recieve a message (Generated logo.svg) in the console that tells you where the logo.svg file is that you have generated.
